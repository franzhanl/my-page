# Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

I am Franz, and this is my dedicated space to showcase the outcomes of my work and passion for web development. Here, you will find the source code of my portfolio, where I delved deeply into HTML, enhanced the visuals with CSS, and added touches of interactivity with JavaScript.

## Highlights:

- **Structured HTML:** I used HTML to build a solid foundation, organizing and presenting the various sections of my portfolio.

- **Enhanced Visual Style:** With a significant emphasis on CSS, I aimed for not just functionality but also aesthetics. Every visual detail was carefully considered to provide a pleasant user experience.

- **Subtle Interactivity with JavaScript:** While the main focus has been on HTML and CSS, I introduced subtle dynamic interactions with JavaScript to enhance the browsing experience
